.. function:: Binary(string)

   Construct an object holding a binary (long) string value.


.. function:: clientversion()

   Return the version of the client library being used as a 5-tuple. The five
   values are the major version, minor version, update number, patch number and
   port update number.

   .. note::

      This method is an extension to the DB API definition and is only
      available in Oracle 10g Release 2 and higher.


.. function:: Connection([user, password, dsn, mode, handle, pool, threaded, twophase])
              connect([user, password, dsn, mode, handle, pool, threaded, twophase])

   Constructor for creating a connection to the database. Return a Connection
   object (:ref:`connobj`). All arguments are optional and can be specified as
   keyword parameters. The dsn (data source name) is the TNS entry (from the
   Oracle names server or tnsnames.ora file) or is a string like the one
   returned from makedsn(). If only one parameter is passed, a connect string
   is assumed which is to be of the format ``user/password@dsn``, the same
   format accepted by Oracle applications such as SQL\*Plus. If the mode is
   specified, it must be one of :data:`SYSDBA` or :data:`SYSOPER` which are
   defined at the module level; otherwise it defaults to the normal mode of
   connecting. If the handle is specified, it must be of type OCISvcCtx\* and
   is only of use when embedding Python in an application (like PowerBuilder)
   which has already made the connection. The pool is only valid in Oracle 9i
   and is a session pool object (:ref:`sesspool`) which is the equivalent of
   calling pool.acquire(). The threaded attribute is expected to be a boolean
   expression which indicates whether or not Oracle should use the mode
   OCI_THREADED to wrap accesses to connections with a mutex. Doing so in
   single threaded applications imposes a performance penalty of about 10-15%
   which is why the default is False. The twophase attribute is expected to be
   a boolean expression which indicates whether or not the attributes should be
   set on the connection object to allow for two phase commit. The default for
   this value is also False because of bugs in Oracle prior to Oracle 10g.


.. function:: Cursor(connection)

   Constructor for creating a cursor.  Return a new Cursor object
   (:ref:`cursorobj`) using the connection.

   .. note::

      This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: Date(year, month, day)

   Construct an object holding a date value.


.. function:: DateFromTicks(ticks)

   Construct an object holding a date value from the given ticks value (number
   of seconds since the epoch; see the documentation of the standard Python
   time module for details).


.. function:: makedsn(host, port, sid)

   Return a string suitable for use as the dsn for the connect() method. This
   string is identical to the strings that are defined by the Oracle names
   server or defined in the tnsnames.ora file.

   .. note::

      This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: SessionPool(user, password, database, min, max, increment, [connectiontype, threaded, getmode=cx_Oracle.SPOOL_ATTRVAL_NOWAIT])

   Create a session pool (see Oracle 9i documentation for more information) and
   return a session pool object (:ref:`sesspool`). This allows for very fast
   connections to the database and is of primary use in a server where the same
   connection is being made multiple times in rapid succession (a web server,
   for example). If the connection type is specified, all calls to acquire()
   will create connection objects of that type, rather than the base type
   defined at the module level. The threaded attribute is expected to be a
   boolean expression which indicates whether or not Oracle should use the mode
   OCI_THREADED to wrap accesses to connections with a mutex. Doing so in
   single threaded applications imposes a performance penalty of about 10-15%
   which is why the default is False.

   .. note::

      This method is an extension to the DB API definition and is only
      available in Oracle 9i.


.. function:: Time(hour, minute, second)

   Construct an object holding a time value.


.. function:: TimeFromTicks(ticks)

   Construct an object holding a time value from the given ticks value (number
   of seconds since the epoch; see the documentation of the standard Python
   time module for details).


.. function:: Timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)

   Construct an object holding a time stamp value.


.. function:: TimestampFromTicks(ticks)

   Construct an object holding a time stamp value from the given ticks value
   (number of seconds since the epoch; see the documentation of the standard
   Python time module for details).

   resource without wrapping it using a mutex semaphore to implement resource
   locking.

   Note that in order to make use of multiple threads in a program which
   intends to connect and disconnect in different threads, the threaded
   argument to the Connection constructor must be a true value. See the
   comments on the Connection constructor for more information (:ref:`module`).

   the OCI function.

   .. note::

      This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. data:: UCBTYPE_EXIT

   This constant is used to register callbacks on exit from the function of the

   This constant is used to register callbacks that completely replace the call
   to the OCI function.

   .. note::

      This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. data:: version

   String constant stating the version of the module. Currently '|release|'.

   .. note::

      This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.



.. _exceptions:

Exceptions
==========

.. exception:: Warning

   Exception raised for important warnings and defined by the DB API but not
   actually used by cx_Oracle.


.. exception:: Error

   Exception that is the base class of all other exceptions defined by
   cx_Oracle and is a subclass of the Python StandardError exception (defined
   in the module exceptions).


.. exception:: InterfaceError

   Exception raised for errors that are related to the database interface
   rather than the database itself. It is a subclass of Error.


.. exception:: DatabaseError

   Exception raised for errors that are related to the database. It is a
   subclass of Error.


.. exception:: DataError

   Exception raised for errors that are due to problems with the processed
   data. It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: OperationalError

   Exception raised for errors that are related to the operation of the
   database but are not necessarily under the control of the progammer. It is a
   subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: IntegrityError

   Exception raised when the relational integrity of the database is affected.
   It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: InternalError

   Exception raised when the database encounters an internal error. It is a
   subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: ProgrammingError

   Exception raised for programming errors. It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: NotSupportedError

   Exception raised when a method or database API was used which is not
   supported by the database. It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


Exception handling
==================

.. note::

   PEP 249 (Python Database API Specification v2.0) says the following about
   exception values:

       [...] The values of these exceptions are not defined. They should
       give the user a fairly good idea of what went wrong, though. [...]

   With cx_Oracle every exception object has exactly one argument in the
   ``args`` tuple. This argument is a ``cx_Oracle._Error`` object which has
   the following three read-only attributes.

.. attribute:: _Error.code

   Integer attribute representing the Oracle error number (ORA-XXXXX).

.. attribute:: _Error.message

   String attribute representing the Oracle message of the error. This
   message is localized by the environment of the Oracle connection.

.. attribute:: _Error.context

   String attribute representing the context in which the exception was
   raised..

This allows you to use the exceptions for example in the following way:

::

    import sys
    import cx_Oracle

    connection = cx_Oracle.Connection("user/pw@tns")
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    try:
        cursor.execute("select 1 / 0 from dual")
    except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError, exc:
        error, = exc.args
        print >> sys.stderr, "Oracle-Error-Code:", error.code
        print >> sys.stderr, "Oracle-Error-Message:", error.message
