Linux Build Hints
-----------------
(Tested on RedHat 4.x, Gentoo 2008.0, Ubuntu 8.x, and Debian 4.x)
These hints are based on using Oracle's instantclient_11_1.  It is necessary to 
download both 'instantclient-linux-basic' and 'instantclient-sdk-linux' from 
oracle.com in order to successfully compile.

Each compressed tarball needs to be extracted to the exact same location.
Uncompress and untar each file from the same location in order to achieve this
result. If placing into a system area such as /opt, /usr/local, make sure you
have the correct permissions to write to these filesystems and/or directories.
It is advisable to use the same account from start to finish for installing
cx_Oracle in order to prevent confusion with overwriting environment settings.

After both packages are untarred a link needs to be made inside the
instantclient_11_1 directory.  For instantclient_11_1 the link looks like
libclntsh.so -> libclntsh.so.10.1.  If you are using a different version
of the instant client simply adjust the link per the version of libclntsh.so.
For example, from inside the instantclient directory, type

ln -s libclntsh.so.x.x linbclntsh.so

Before building and compiling you must set ORACLE_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH for
the installation user, presumably 'root' but not mandatory.  Pay careful
attention not to lose environment settings if you change users via 'su' or
'sudo', etc.


OS X Build Hints
----------------
(Tested on Leopard 10.5.x)
The procedures for OS X are almost idential to Linux except for the package 
names and a few environmental caveats. For OS X it is necessary to download
both 'instantclient-basic-macosx' and 'instantclient-sdk-macosx'.

For OS X it is mandatory to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to $ORACLE_HOME. For the
instant client this is the location where you installed the packages. It is
necessary to set this environment variable as well as those specified for Linux
(ORACLE_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) inside $HOME/.profile and start a new shell
before testing cx_Oracle. If .profile does not exist, simply create one with
your favorite editor and add the necessary path info to these variables.

   Example ($HOME/.profile):
   -------------------------
   export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/local/instantclient_11_1
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME
   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME


Building and Compilation
------------------------
Use the provided setup.py to build and install the module which makes use of 
the distutils module. Note that on Windows, I have used mingw32 
(http://www.mingw.org) and the module will not build with MSVC without 
modification. The commands required to build and install the module are as 
follows:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install


Testing (Post Installation Quick Test)
--------------------------------------
A very quick installation test can be performed from the command line using
the Python interpreter. Below is an example of how this done. After importing
cx_Oracle there should be a line containing only '>>>' which indicates the
library successfully loaded.

    $ python
    Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Oct 25 2008, 19:37:28) 
    [GCC 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2 p1.1)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import cx_Oracle
    >>>
